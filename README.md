metaboapp
=========

Fun, competitive and collaborative social online game where users simulate bacteria, contributing to real discovery.

Opportunity: Better biofuels, waste processing and disease treatment come from iterative trial-and-error experiments that attempt to optimize organism metabolic functions and conditions. Because iterative trial-and-error experiments in these fields are very costly and time-consuming, computational metabolic simulation has become an essential first step. Current simulations have already saved a large amount of time and money, often by narrowing down the lists of candidate reagents and experimental conditions to try. However, simulations are still in the very early stages of development, and thus are non-optimized and do not have enough disparate labs working to validate or disprove certain computational approaches. Thus,  science and industry invest heavily in improved metabolic simulation. 
The game Foldit recently empowered lay users to outperform scientific labs at predicting protein structures.1 Processing power and systems biology advances2 demonstrate that crowdsourcing to predict organism-scale biological function is now possible and worthwhile.

Solution: Metaboapp combines the fun, competitiveness and collaborative benefits of social online gaming with non-scientists significantly contributing to areas such as development of more efficient biofuels, more effective disease treatments and better understanding of biological processes.
Users design and control organisms or colonies with daily improvement incentives from resource competition or direct user ‘combat’. Players are rewarded (with points toward a high scores table, for example) for more function-efficient organisms and optimizing function conditions. Thus, players narrow down the lists of candidate reagents (bacteria types, feed types, ...) and experimental conditions which will then be applied to experiments already ongoing today in industry and academia, vastly accelerating their progress in the fields discussed above. With our simple toolkit’s power, ~100 competing/collaborating users will yield more useful results faster than the small volume of scientific community simulations.
The software runs on any browser including iPhone and Android. Unlike any machine learning approach, as are currently the methods academia and industry use to attempt to optimize experiments via simulation, players working collaboratively develop and explore new strategies and algorithms.

Development: Simulations perform server-based calculations; players experience only visually stimulating, interactive effects in action. Bioinformatics labs at SD Supercomputer Center, UCSD and Purdue provide cutting-edge models:

Extremely complex calculations, which would take hours or days to complete on industrial or academic computer clusters, will be outsourced to users’ devices to boost computational power on a scale that, given several thousand users, will never be available to the biotech industry or scientific community.

Potential: Metaboapp provides fun, simple, fast, on-demand, multi-platform, educational/informative, useful simulations that advance biological R&D in a reward-based social competitive/collaborative environment. 
The players' experience is as graphics-rich and enjoyable as World of Warcraft, and as scientifically engaging and potentially productive toward biotech R&D as Foldit. However, currently, there are no similar games / competitors out there.
We simulate microorganisms with the best-characterized, simplest metabolic networks, data from which will provide novel
functional insights. However, the goal is a framework simulating metabolic functions of any organism. User contributions, such as
optimized conditions that reduce biofuel production costs, will be patented and sold, and user contributors offered avenues to participate in an R&D lab where the fruits of their labors are taken to the next stage.
